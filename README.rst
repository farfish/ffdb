FarFish FFDB content ingest
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This project provides a templated upload form for documents made up of any
number of table objects. Documents are stored as JSONB within a Postgresql
database, which can then be used to construct views on the data.

All old versions of documents are saved, and can be easily restored.

There is a flexible schema to define each table within the document, and a
table can have either a fixed list of columns / rows or a flexble number
provided by the user. `handsontable`_ is used to provide the table component.

Documents can also be exported / imported from excel spreadsheets using
`js-xlsx`_, where each table will be on a separate sheet in the document. The
import is intelligent enough to notice row / column reorderings and reassign
data.

Prerequisites
-------------

Install the following server prerequisites::

    sudo apt install \
        nginx \
        python3-venv python3-dev \
        postgresql libpq-dev

Install nodejs to complile the front-end::

    # NB: We need at least node >= 6.9.0, so you may need:
    sudo apt install -t stretch-backports nodejs npm

Installation
------------

Create a ``.local-conf`` for your site configuration, see the top of
``install.sh`` for available options, and then create. For example::

    cat <<EOF > .local-conf
    SERVICE_MODE=production
    SERVER_NAME=ffdb.*
    APP_GA_KEY=UA-XXXXX-Y
    EOF

Run make to compile::

    make

Finally run install to create a systemd service and nginx configuration:

    sudo ./install.sh

Manual Upload / Download with cURL
----------------------------------

Download a document::

    curl 'http://ffdb-host/api/doc/dlmtool/document_name''http://ffdb-host/api/doc/dlmtool/document_name'

Upload a document::

    curl -v -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
