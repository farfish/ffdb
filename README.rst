Farfish FFDB content ingest
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This project provides a templated upload form for documents made up of any
number of table objects. Documents are stored as JSONB within a Postgresql
database, which can then be used to construct views on the data.

All old versions of documents are saved, and can be easily restored.

There is a flexible schema to define each table within the document, and a
table can have either a fixed list of columns / rows or a flexble number
provided by the user. `handsontable`_ is used to provide the table component.

Documents can also be exported / imported from excel spreadsheets using
`js-xlsx`_, where each table will be on a separate sheet in the document. The
import is intelligent enough to notice row / column reorderings and reassign
data.

Install the following prerequisites::

    sudo apt install \
        python3-venv python3-dev \
